        "  - These warnings do not stop the process but indicate that future versions of MLflow may require updates to the code for full compatibility and best practices.\n",
        "  - Specifically, the warning about missing model signature suggests that input/output schema is not automatically captured, which could affect model deployment or reproducibility.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. **Model Registration:**\n",
        "  - The output shows that the model 'CreditRiskModel_BestModel' was already registered in the MLflow Model Registry.\n",
        "  - Instead of failing, MLflow created a new version (version '4') of the existing registered model.\n",
        "  - This is expected behavior when retraining and re-registering models with the same name.\n",
        " 3. **Process Completion:**\n",
        "  - Despite the warnings, the process completed successfully.\n",
        "  - The best model was selected, logged, and registered in MLflow, ensuring experiment tracking and model versioning.\n",
        " 4. **Implications:**\n",
        "   - The workflow is robust and supports iterative model development.\n",
        "   - To further improve, consider updating the MLflow logging code to include model signatures and input examples, and replace deprecated parameters.\n",
        "   - The MLflow Model Registry now contains multiple versions of the best model, which is useful for model comparison and rollback if needed.\n"
